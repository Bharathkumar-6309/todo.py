# todo.py
 To-Do List Application (Python)

A simple command-line **To-Do List Manager** built using Python. This application allows users to **add**, **remove**, and **view** tasks. Tasks are stored in a plain text file (`tasks.txt`) so that they persist even after the program is closed.
-  Add a new task
-  Remove an existing task
-  View all tasks
-  Save tasks to a text file (`tasks.txt`)
